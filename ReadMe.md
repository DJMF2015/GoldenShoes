### Challenges:
● Declining revenue
● not mobile responsive
● Customer contact limited to phone support line only
● Website has ‘dated’ layout

### Design issues:
● accessibility,
● screen-size,
● appearance

### Functional issues:
● Non-mobile responsive;
● Flawed Returns process;
● Issue with ‘stock’ being flagged as ‘in-stock’ when is actually out-of-stock;
● Lack of ability to choose from shoe colour choice,
● Shoe style and shoe size,
● Social media presence unmonitored and customers appear to be able to ‘share’ from
every part of the website.
● Marketing Depart. sends out ‘vouchers’ by post of customers whose details they collect -
but can be used in-store’ only and not online.

### MVP:
1. Users should be able to view a list of all products in stock
2. User must be able to add, remove, edit/update a product to their shopping ‘cart’
3. Users should be warned if an item is ‘out of stock’. Should be ‘clearly displayed’
4. Users should be able to choose from a selection of shoe colours; shoe sizes; shoe style.
5. Users should be able to checkout their items with the total amount correctly displayed.
6. Users must have the choice to ‘order/buy’ at checkout stage.
7. Users should be able to ‘filter’ a product by category
8. Should have a contact form for customer support.
9. Users’ social media should be limited to certain parts of a website only....

As an AND Digital Associate, we want you to summarise;

● Present your recommendations in a presentation and coded out demo format. You will need to bring this with you to your interview, as the Client will spend approximately 20 minutes going over it with you

#### Some suggestions to help you structure your thoughts;
- Think about the challenges Golden Show face, and why these exist
- What solution(s) could AND Digital provide
- How/why is this attractive?
- Impact of these solutions
- Remember you only have 20 minutes to present this to your Client
- Get creative, think about what you’ve seen work (and didn’t work) in your day to day
shopping experiences
- You must produce working front end and back end code. Please bundle your code
over to your recruiter in advance of the assessment centre so we
can take a look.
